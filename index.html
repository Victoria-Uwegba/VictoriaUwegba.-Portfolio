        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My path into tech isn't conventional, but it's a journey I'm passionate about. My background in Accounting taught me valuable skills in problem-solving, attention to detail, and perseverance. I've honed my ability to manage projects, communicate effectively, and collaborate with diverse teams. These skills have provided a strong foundation that I'm eager to build upon in the tech industry.
What drew me to tech is its limitless potential for innovation and its power to shape the future. I've taken the initial steps to learn the fundamentals of coding, and I'm already captivated by its creative and problem-solving aspects.</p>
